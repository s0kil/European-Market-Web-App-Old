        <p>We have started our company in Chattanooga, TN in November 1999. When we opened our store, we started to
            sell
            only Russian products. Then we had a lot of other customers from different countries requesting products
            from
            their countries. We started to add a lot of other products and now we sell products from 25 countries, that
            include Russia, Ukraine, German, Italy, England, Poland, Greece, and others.</p>
        <p>We also started to make homemade cabbage rolls, pierogies, bulochki, chebureki, blintzes and bake German
            bread
            daily.</p>
        <p>We now have 6 locations open, and very excited that our 7th location in Boiling Springs, SC will be opening
            very
            soon.</p>
